Some Measurements on the Effects of the Curse of Dimensionality: 
   *New experiments show that particle swarm optimization and differential evolution have super-linear growth in convergence time as dimensionality grows. \n
   *In general, the number of generations required for convergence is mostly constant with respect to population size. \n
   *The resources required for convergence grow super-linealy with dimensions. \n
   *A similar super-linear growth rate in the number of generations required for convergence is also observed in DE.
